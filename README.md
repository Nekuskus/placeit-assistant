This project is based on the game [PlaceIt](https://github.com/Dae314/placeit-game), originally developed by [Dae314](https://github.com/Dae314).

It aims to find optimal moves in the game for each provided number through a simple check on equally distributed range values.

Run with `cargo run` in project root, use the `play_random_games.py [count (default: 100)]` script to generate an example history for benchmarking and statistics.
